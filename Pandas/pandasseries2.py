# A Pandas series is like a column in a table . it is 1D array which holds data of any type.
# here we will create a simple pandas series.

print(sharadnew)

# labeling - label can be use to access a specified value.
import pandas as pd

# wuth Create label you can create your own name labels:
import pandas as pd
sharad = [1,7,2]
sharadnew = pd.Series(sharad, index=["x", "y", "z"])
print(sharadnew)

# labeling - label can be use to access a specified value.(after creating own label)

# you can also use a key or value object like a dictionary, when creating a series.
# here we will create a simple pandas series from a dictionary.

print(result)

# DataFrame: Data sets in pandas are usually multidimentional tables,, and they re called DataFrames.
# series are like columns and dataframes is the whole table.

# we will now create a dataframe from 2 series.
